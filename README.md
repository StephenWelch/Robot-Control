Robot-Control
---

This project was my way of getting to grips with Team 254's geometry and physic modeling classes.

# What can it do?
Robot-Control is capable of intaking our team's (1885) drivebase logs as CSV and calculating the path it traveled throughout a match.
It's also capable of simulating the path-following behavior using a time-varying non-linear trajectory-following controller (a.k.a Ramsete) or a polar-coordinate based pose-stabilization controller. Trajectories are generated using Pathfinder.
Output is written to CSV and displayed using GNUPlot.
